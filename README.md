# monitor-and-copy
monitors a specific folder and if something gets added it'll move to another folder. 
I've added a line to remove the source file after it's copied. I'm hoping that will avoid the same file being copied several times. 

This will probably be abandoned, I just added a 5 second delay to the start of my original script and that seems to have solved my issue. This script was a misguided attempt to solve a problem that most likely would've appeared in this script as well. (the scanner didn't give up control of the document before the script started so I was getting an error and the script wouldn't execute)
